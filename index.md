>  **I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingly power: proclaim the word; be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient; convince, reprimand, encourage through all patience and teaching. For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine but, following their own desires and insatiable curiosity, will accumulate teachers and will stop listening to the truth and will be diverted to myths.** *2 Timothy 4:1-4*

Today the world more and more is rejecting traditional Christian morals. This rejection has even entered into the Church with many, including some bishops, calling for changes in Church teaching. Among the changes that are sought are the ordination of women to Sacred Orders, the acceptance of homosexual acts as virtuous, the admission of divorced and remarried to Communion, and the acceptance of contraception. These issues are even to be included in the discussions of the upcoming Synod on Synodality. All of these are clearly contrary to sacred Scripture and the constant teaching of the Church. To call for changes in these teachings is a rejection of the very nature of the Church as possessing an infallible teaching authority established by our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
### Pope Pius X stated:
 
The office divinely committed to Us of feeding the Lordâ€™s flock has especially this duty assigned to it by Christ, namely, to guard with the greatest vigilance the deposit of the faith delivered to the saints, rejecting the profane novelties of words and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called. (Pascendi )
 
Rather than being opposed, the promoters of these changes in Church teachings have been tolerated and even elevated to the highest positions. Meanwhile, those who would maintain and protect Church teaching have been vilified and marginalized. 

 
#### The Official Handbook for the Synod on Synodality states:
 In a synodal Church the whole community, in the free and rich diversity of its members, is called together to pray, listen, analyse, dialogue, discern and offer advice on making pastoral decisions which correspond as closely as possible to God's will (ICT, Syn., 67-68). Genuine efforts must be made to ensure the inclusion of those at the margins or who feel excluded.
