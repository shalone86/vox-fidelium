I firmly embrace and accept each and every definition that has been set forth and declared by the unerring teaching authority of the Church, especially those principle truths which are directly opposed to the errors of the day.
 
And first of all, I profess that I believe with firm faith that the Church, the guardian and teacher of the revealed word, was personally instituted by the real and historical Christ when he lived among us, and that the Church was built upon Peter, the prince of the apostolic hierarchy, and his successors for the duration of time. 
 
Secondly, I sincerely hold that the doctrine of faith was handed down to us from the apostles through the orthodox Fathers in exactly the same meaning and always in the same purport. Therefore, I entirely reject the heretical misrepresentation that dogmas evolve and change from one meaning to another different from the one which the Church held previously.
 
In particular, I believe that God created man in two sexes, male and female, and that there does not exist a gender or gender identity apart from one’s biological sex.
 
Likewise, I profess that sexual activity is proper only within marriage, the unique and permanent union between one man and one woman. I further affirm that sexual activity outside of marriage, including all such activity between persons of the same sex, is a grave sin and, if unrepentant, precludes one’s entrance into the kingdom of Heaven.
 
I also hold that each and every marital act must of necessity retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life. An act of mutual love which impairs the capacity to transmit life which God the Creator, through specific laws, has built into it, frustrates His design which constitutes the norm of marriage, and contradicts the will of the Author of life. Excluded is any action which either before, at the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation—whether as an end or as a means.
 
I proclaim that Jesus Christ, by his divine sovereignty, limited the sacrament of Holy Orders, in all of its degrees, to men. Thus the Church does not have the ability to extend this sacrament to women. I reject the false charge that following the example of our Lord is in any way unjust toward women.
 
I also profess that, following the words of our most blessed Lord, marriage is a permanent union between man and wife, and that if anyone should divorce and remarry that they are committing the grave sin of adultery, which, if unrepentant, leads to eternal damnation.
 
I sincerely hold that to welcome grave sinners, including to holy Communion, without a clear call to repentance is not an act of charity, but of cowardice, a scandal that leads to a hardness of heart and falsely suggests that one can enter into eternal life while willfully remaining in sin. 
 
I firmly hold, then, and shall hold to my dying breath the belief of the Fathers in the charism of truth, which certainly is, was, and always will be in the succession of the episcopacy from the apostles. The purpose of this is, then, not that dogma may be tailored according to what seems better and more suited to the culture of each age; rather, that the absolute and immutable truth preached by the apostles from the beginning may never be believed to be different, may never be understood in any other way.
